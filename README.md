# Problem Statement
## Existing Problem
In initial days, there existed a communication gap between those who preferred solar panel installation and Vendors/Manufacturers/Fitters.
Due to this, either there was no proper awareness of the solar quote installation process or the whole process was costlier than one could afford due to several reasons that we have stated in the drawbacks section.
## Our Approach
- Our objective is to modernize the way rooftop solar is sold and contributing towards 100% renewables by using technologies described in the technologies section.
- Through our website, we enable property owners to enjoy a hassle-free digital solar journey and aid them in making a better solar decision.


# Technologies
## Frontend 
- Figma
- HTML, CSS, JS
- Java / Python


## Backend
### Machine Learning
Roof Dimensions are detected by Data Classifier Model of neural networks and the roof is detected using Google Static Maps API (the way in which exact dimensions of roof is detected when we use Google Maps in satellite mode.)

### APIs:
### SAWO API
- We used SAWO API for Sign-Up, Sign-In, Log-in  <br>
### Twillio
- Chatbot for Personal Assistance, that takes fields of the consumers that have queries related to Location, Pricing, Website Navigations, or talking personally to the expert. Also, providing the consumers/website viewers an option to ask queries according to their needs. <br>
### Symbol API
- Sentiment analysis.
- Tracking and setting constant promotional emails. <br>
### Coil
- Redemmed the code and provided Web monetization. <br>
### GoDaddy
- Hosting Platform



# Project Result
### Boosts Productivity, Reduces Time & Cost:
With the help of the satellite images, our model estimates the rooftop area, the solar intensity value, the number of solar panels required to cover the rooftop, estimated costs of installation, cost recovery rate and the total savings on electricity bills.
### Reduction of Operating Cost (I didnt understand this point, any of you guys can rewrite the statement for the below if you understand, or else we can remove this point also)
We also intend to solve the problem "15% of the total costing of big solar projects costs go into the area assessment & analysis". With help of this model, this cost will become Minimum or Zero.
### Moving towards Zero-Carbon Future
- Low Thermal Pollution.
- Less Radioactive Waste.
- Zero Carbon Emission.


# Conclusion
- The Solar Al Model makes the work more easier and smoother. Due to the effectiveness of this system, user can easily get connected to the nearby vendors which makes it an effortless system.
- From now, consumers will no longer have to pay unnecessary commissions to the Vendors & fitters.
- As Solar Energy is a 100% renewable form of energy
    -It reduces the waiting period-power cut.
    -It makes ZERO Chances of faulty electricity bills.
    -It reduces thermal & Radioactive Emission and helps to move towards Zero Carbon Future.
- Since this model is completely bootstrapped C2C, it acts as a Zomato which Connects Consumers to Vendors resulting in ZERO Capital Investment


# Drawbacks
## Drawbacks of old project
### High Electricity Bill
    Lack of Transparency in bill generation and supply
### No Justified Clarifications
    Poor Support Desk, Improper justifications
### Poor Feedback Mechanism
    Gap between vendors, Fitters and Suppliers resulting in high commission.


# Drawbacks of our project
- Intermittency: caused by variable weather conditions. It only produces energy when the sun is shining
- Land Use: it needs a significant amount of land


# Future Advancements 
1. We implemented a chatbot that takes input queries related to depending on the consumer's location, the map shows nearby stores where the solar quotes can be bought. (The same way how the google maps show nearby restaurants,places,.)
2. technologies->backend->3rd point if we just show demo, then we can write this point of implementing in future.
3. Web monetization (if we are not going to do it now, include it in fure advancements section.)
4. scross/xcross whatever amaan was telling, if we implement that, it ensures that consumers will definitely get their solar quote installed on their rooftop if they have paid for it. It ensures that no fraud/scam is done.
